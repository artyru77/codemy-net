In this episode we take a look at how Framework7 structures it's content. We try out a few examples from the kitchen sink provided by Framework7's documentation. 

We'll show you how to render your content and talk about how framework7 transitions from page to page using ajax requests.

You'll see how to use Rails 4.1 Variants in combination with Framework7 to build a mobile optimized site.
