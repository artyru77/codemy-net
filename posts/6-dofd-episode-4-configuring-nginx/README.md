In this video I show you how to write an nginx server block.

## Notable Nginx Folders

```
/etc/nginx           - this is where nginx config files are stored
/etc/sites-available - this is where you put your app's nginx config file
/etc/sites-enabled   - this is where you create the symbolic link to enable your app
/var/log/nginx       - this is where you'll find all of nginx master log files
```
